# LoanBook

Private lending circles with persistent chat and zero-interest, unsecured USDC loans on Arc. LoanBook coordinates direct transfers; it does not pool or custody loan principal.

Originally built in [Arc Studio](https://studio.arc.io/app/02e165d9-bda4-4b41-ab19-757f5511337e). Existing repository: https://github.com/lightokey839-rgb/Loanbook. Builder: https://x.com/LIGHTDESIGN2022.

## Current release status — 29 October 2026

This is a locally implemented, tested release candidate with its additive Supabase upgrade and receipt verifier now deployed to the existing Loanbook project. A review branch named `codex/loanbook-release-candidate` was created from the current GitHub `main` head; source changes have not yet been pushed into it. No public frontend has been deployed. Mainnet contract and demonstration transactions remain outstanding. GitHub reported the existing repository as private during inspection.

## Local use

Use Node 24 and npm. Run npm ci, copy .env.example to a local .env with public browser configuration, then npm run dev. For production preview: npm run build followed by npm run preview. npm is the canonical lockfile for this release; the original bun.lock is historical.

Checks: npm run check; npm test; npm run test:db; npm run test:contracts. Contract compilation uses Solidity 0.8.28. Windows environments that cannot resolve Foundry's compiler home can pass --use with a verified local solc executable.

## Main flows

Connect wallet → sign the SIWE login message → create/join a circle → chat → request USDC → offer to lend → borrower selects a lender → create onchain agreement → lender approves and funds → borrower approves and repays. Direct Loans remains separate and does not depend on Supabase.

RLS protects private conversations. Onchain terms, amounts and wallet addresses are public. Loans are unsecured; repayment cannot be forced. Use only trusted counterparties.

Read DEPLOYMENT.md, TEST_RESULTS.md, SECURITY_REVIEW.md and NEXT_STEPS.md before release. Older documents under docs/ and Studio deployment scripts are retained for provenance, not current production instructions.
