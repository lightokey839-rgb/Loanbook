# Current handover — 29 October 2026

Read README.md and NEXT_STEPS.md first. The fresh schema is already installed remotely; do not rerun it. The additive 004 migration has passed local tests but is NOT deployed. No GitHub push, public frontend deployment or mainnet transaction was performed. The following Studio memory is historical provenance and may describe earlier states.

# LoanBook

> Built with Arc Studio - money-powered apps in minutes

This is the **project memory** - what Arc Studio remembers about building this app. It helps future agents (or humans) understand and extend the project.

---

## What This App Does

LoanBook is a private community P2P USDC micro-loan registry on Arc Testnet. Members connect wallets, create private circles, discuss small fixed-term zero-interest USDC loans, and fund/repay those loans onchain. The contract coordinates direct lender→borrower and borrower→lender USDC transfers via ERC-20 allowances; it never custodies funds.

## Deployed Contracts

### LoanBook
- **Network:** Arc Testnet (Chain ID: 5042002)

## Build Status

- Phase 1 complete: contract written, security-reviewed, Slither-analyzed, 31/31 unit tests passing, deployed.
- Phase 2 frontend complete: wallet-connected interface with create/fund/repay/cancel flows, network guard, USDC balance display, tx state feedback, Arc Explorer links. Lint + typecheck pass clean.
- Phase 2 testnet lifecycle: BLOCKED pending wallet signatures from user.

## Frontend Files (Phase 2)

- `src/App.tsx` — main app, landing/tab layout
- `src/loanbook-contract.ts` — ABI, address, types, helpers
- `src/onchain-error.ts` — user-friendly error messages
- `src/components/WalletBar.tsx` — ConnectKit button + USDC balance
- `src/components/NetworkGuard.tsx` — enforces Arc Testnet, prompts switch
- `src/components/CreateLoanPanel.tsx` — borrower creates a loan
- `src/components/ApproveAndFundPanel.tsx` — lender 2-step approve+fund
- `src/components/ApproveAndRepayPanel.tsx` — borrower 2-step approve+repay
- `src/components/LookupPanel.tsx` — load any loan by ID, shows correct action panel
- `src/components/LoanCard.tsx` — live loan detail card
- `src/components/LoanStatusBadge.tsx` — status pill (Open/Funded/Repaid/Cancelled/Overdue)
- `src/components/TxButton.tsx` — button with signing/confirming/success states
- `src/components/TxReceipt.tsx` — tx hash + Arc Explorer link

## Design Decisions

- Contract is immutable — no owner, no admin, no upgradability.
- Private community membership is enforced at the offchain/chat layer (Supabase), not onchain.
- Loan terms and counterparties are publicly readable onchain (inherent to EVM transparency). "Private" refers to the social/chat layer only.
- Overdue status is derived (Funded + block.timestamp > dueDate), never stored.
- Loan IDs start at 1 (loanCount pre-incremented).

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Web3: wagmi v2, viem v2, ConnectKit
- Contracts: Solidity 0.8.28 + Foundry. Sources in `contracts/`, unit tests in `contracts/test/*.t.sol`. Build with `bun run contracts:build` (`forge build`), test with `bun run contracts:test` (`forge test`).
- Wallet: injected (MetaMask, etc.)
- Chain: Arc Testnet (Chain ID: 5042002, imported from `viem/chains`)
- Token: USDC (6 decimals) (Address: 0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000, Chain: Arc Testnet)
- Toasts: Sonner

## Key Files

- `src/App.tsx` - Main application logic
- `src/components/` - UI components
- `src/config.ts` - wagmi config (chains, connectors, transports)

## Supabase / Database

**State:** Database is EMPTY (confirmed 2026-10-28 via SQL Editor).
**Migration to run:** `supabase/migrations/001_loanbook_fresh_install.sql`
This is a single-file fresh-install migration combining all schema, RLS policies, and
SECURITY DEFINER functions. Tested 58/58 against Docker Postgres 15 (empty DB).
Do NOT run the older numbered migrations (001_loanbook_schema, 002_security_hardening,
003_native_web3_auth) — they are superseded by the fresh-install file.

**Before running:** Enable Ethereum Web3 provider in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Web3.

**Identity structure (verified from Supabase Auth Go source, 2026-10-28):**
`auth.identities.identity_data->'custom_claims'->>'address'` — SIWE-verified wallet.
`auth.identities.provider` = `'web3'`

## To Run

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```
